# Docker-php-fpm

This project is a docker-compose boilerplate to help you launch a PHP application fast. This small docker compose stack will launch the latest php-fpm, in combination with the latest nginx, both runnning on alpine.

### Launch your server

* Clone the project to us as your web server.
* Add a .env file in your project. The `SOURCE_FOLDER` variable should point to your php application folder path.
* Enter `php-docker.local:8080` to reach your website (@see nginx/site.conf)

### Additionnal tips
* Since we will be using docker volumes, we need to change group ownership for the application code to GID 2048. _The GID 2048 is arbitrary, this is the group I chose to run the php-fpm container. See the Dockerfile. (Go read Niels SÃ¸holm [article](https://medium.com/@nielssj/docker-volumes-and-file-system-permissions-772c1aee23ca))if you want to know more about volumes and permissions_
```sh
chown 2018:2048 ${SOURCE_FOLDER}
chmod 775 ${SOURCE_FOLDER}
chmod g+s ${SOURCE_FOLDER}
```

* To run composer from a container; run this in your `SOURCE_FOLDER`
```sh
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/app composer install
```
